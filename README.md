From [YHF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/incremental-development/master/README.md):  

You will study and reverse-engineer the [__acme-web-design__ tutorial from Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw).

Writing the same code as Mr. Traversy's code is not enough! You are expected to submit your code from his tutorial in a new repository on your GitHub account using [this starter repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/w3-validation-template).  Your repository should be named `acme-web-design` and should be cleanly developed with one branch per step.  It's up to you to decide what the steps are and in what order to build them.  When you have a plan for how to develop the site in steps you should write this into a development strategy!

Your workflow for this project should be the same workflow you practiced in class.  For each step in your development strategy you should develop on a new branch. After completing the code for one step (on one branch) you should push that branch to GitHub and merge to master using a Pull Request.

A good strategy to for completing this project is the __three-step__:

1. follow the tutorial studying the code and understanding the project.
2. look over your finished code and break it down into steps, write your development strategy.
3. study the tutorial a second time, following your strategy to build your repository one branch at a time


You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, your development strategy, the correctness of your branches, and the completeness of your repository. Your repository must contain:
